### Hi Friends ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Saurabh. I'm currently working as Senior Data/ML Engineer in ABN AMRO Bank. I've worked on various data-centric roles with different capcity throughout my career and I love building, solutioning and learning all the cool things around Data. In my spare time I play cricket, run, read books (English and [Hindi](https://topbooksreview.com/20-famous-indian-hindi-writers-of-all-time/)), and write [blogs](https://medium.com/@saurabh2.mishra).
